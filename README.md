# Text-Summarizer
# Text Summarizer using Transformers 🧠📄

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **automatic text summarizer** using pre-trained transformer models. The summarizer processes long-form textual content (such as news articles, research papers, or documentation) and generates concise summaries that retain the core meaning. The project leverages the `transformers` library from Hugging Face and is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format for experimentation and clarity.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- ✅ **Content condensation** for long articles and blogs  
- ✅ **Summarizing reports or documentation**  
- ✅ **Educational assistance** for summarizing academic texts  
- ✅ **Data preprocessing** for NLP pipelines  
- ✅ **Reducing reading time** while retaining essential information  

## 🛠️ What This Notebook Does

### 1. 📦 Library Imports
The notebook imports all necessary libraries such as:
- `transformers` for accessing pre-trained models
- `torch` for tensor computations
- `IPython` for display formatting

### 2. 🔄 Model Selection and Pipeline
- Uses `pipeline` API from Hugging Face for summarization
- The model used is likely one of:
  - `facebook/bart-large-cnn`  
  - `google/pegasus-xsum`  
  - or similar transformer-based summarizers

### 3. 📝 Input Text
- Long input texts are defined directly in the notebook
- These could be articles, paragraphs, or custom-written content

### 4. ⚙️ Summarization
- The summarization pipeline tokenizes and processes the input text
- Generates an output summary based on configured parameters like:
  - `max_length`
  - `min_length`
  - `do_sample`

### 5. 📤 Output Display
- The generated summary is printed in a readable format
- Used for quick validation of the summarization quality
